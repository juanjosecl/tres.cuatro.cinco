## Features

### Exisiting features

#### Navigation bar

 the navigation bar ensures effortless browsing. The choice of fonts and colors provide good readability and visual comfort. On larger screens, our navigation bar boasts the restaurant's logo on the left, exuding our brand identity, while neatly organized links to various sections of the page reside on the right, granting direct access to your desired content.

For smaller screens, i have maintained this user-friendly approach by placing the logo on the left, accompanied by a sleek hamburger menu on the left.

#### Home section

On the homepage, I decided to keep it simple and created a banner. This banner displays a picture of one of our famous dishes, which is the hamburger. On the right side, you'll find the restaurant's logo. At the top of the image, there is a subtitle with the name of the restaurant and a brief explanation.

#### About Us section

This page offers users a glimpse into the essence of TRES CUATRO CINCO. It begins with a "HISTORY" section, delving into the restaurant's origins and our gastronomic philosophy, providing a comprehensive understanding of our journey and culinary approach.

![History](assets/readme_images/about_us_history.jpg)

Right Below the "HISTORY" section, you will encounter a circular image of the restaurant´s main salon. In my opinion it gives style to the site. By mixing pictures and text we are giving a better user experience.

![Picture of the restaurant´s salon](assets/readme_images/circle_about_us.jpg)

The "About Us" section also includes a dedicated working hours section. It is imperative for users visiting the webpage to know when they can enjoy lunch or dinner. This information is clearly presented in a list right below the salon image.

It features two pictures—one showcasing our selection of drinks, and the other highlighting a delectable piece of beef. Within each picture, you'll find a button that directs you to the respective menu, where you can explore our diverse range of offerings.

+ First Name
+ Last Name

This information enables the restaurant to reach out and facilitate various types of business bookings. On the right side of the section, you'll also find an additional restaurant logo, adding an elegant touch to this part of the website.

#### Footer section

In the footer section, I've aimed to provide clients with crucial information. Firstly, you'll discover the restaurant's location on Google Maps, making it easier for people to locate TRES CUATRO CINCO. Additionally, there are links to all of our social media platforms, where you can explore various types of content.

![Footer Section](assets/readme_images/footer_readme.jpg)

#### Gallery Page

The gallery page prominently displays various images that highlight our work within the restaurant. I have intentionally arranged these images to create a collage-like appearance rather than a rigid organizational structure. Furthermore, when you hover over an image, a special effect allows for a clearer view.

Directly below the image section, you will discover the "Contact Us" section and the footer, providing the client with an opportunity to learn more about our services and have immediate access to our contact information and location.

### Future features

As previously mentioned in this document, this project represents a prototype website for an actual restaurant based in Colombia. As a result, there are a few implementations that can be made in order for the site to be more user friendly

+ Enhancements to the dropdown navigation menu to align with best practices and improve user experience.
+ include in the gallery section videos that show the process of food preparation.
+ Create an actual data base where I can interact with clients to grow business events.

## Testing

The most challenging aspect of this assignment, for me, was determining the positioning of elements. Typically, I use flexbox for such tasks, but in this project, I discovered the benefits of Bootstrap. Bootstrap enabled me to achieve superior element positioning on the webpage, particularly through the use of classes like 'container,' 'row,' and 'col-sm-#.' These classes significantly improved the page layout. While testing for proper positioning was initially difficult, I eventually succeeded

Regarding browser compatibility, the webpage functions seamlessly on Edge, Mozilla, and Chrome. Furthermore, I used dev tools to ensure the webpage's responsiveness on desktops, cellphones, and tablets. In addition, the form in the events area is fully functional, requiring correct input for each field. Lastly, the navbar effectively navigates users to their intended sections of the page.

## Credits

### Code

as explained in the testing area, the most difficult part for me was the flexbox usage. That´s when i was able to discover the bootstrap library in specific this classes: container, row, col-sm-#. I was able to understand how it works studying the bootstrap main page specifically here: 

<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/>

this allowed me to organize media and text within each div in different ways that I was not able to do with just flex-box before.

In addition, bootstrap also helped me with the navbar and the hamburguer menu. I think it allowed me to organize faster each part of the page and helped me be more efficient with my time which is what coders should be aiming to do when they start workig. For the navbar codes, again studied the bootstrap main page dedicated to navbar. you can find it here.

<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/>

Lastly, for the social media section, I drew inspiration from the code presented in the Running Walkthrough project, available in the Common Curriculum. You can access this resource through the following link:

### Media

All the photos featured in this project were taken directly within the restaurant premises. No external images were sourced or downloaded for this endeavor.

Regarding icons, as previously mentioned, I employed Font Awesome icons, which are prominently visible in the social media section and the "About Us" segment.

Should you require additional information about the images used, please feel free to contact the official restaurant photographer at this email address.
